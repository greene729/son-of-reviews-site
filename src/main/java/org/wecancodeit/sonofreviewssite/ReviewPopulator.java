It is covered in the finest layer of cat hair, from said Great Aunt Mable. He begins wearing this sweater sometime in mid November and does not take it off till the new year. I dare say he bathes in it. Of all his sweaters this is one of my favorites.",

Greg bought this his sophomore year after he finished his cynical phase, and almost lost it in the lake during one of our late-night escapades. The way it smelled for the next week, I wish he had.",

There was the time share in Nepal, there was the vacation to Indianapolis, but his Halloween Sweater makes it into the cannon of great disasters. It is neither spooky, nor cute. I've never felt the hint of a shiver run down my spine. I've never felt warm, fuzzy, harvest-time feelings either. What purpose does this sweater serve? What is its target audience? I don't think anyone knows.",

I went back and forth on this, but I decided in the end that while it gains no points for fashion, taste, respectability, sense, or general ability of anyone accompanying Greg to maintain their composure, it has its own appeal. When Greg was in high school, he spent a summer abroad in Bratislava, and his little sister decided it might get cold there, so she bought him a wool sweater. As soon as Greg arrived in Czechoslovakia he washed and dried his sweater and shrunk it down to dog size. He felt so bad about it that he continued wearing it anyway, and has since.",

He didn't belive in Y2K and wore this sweater to our New Years party that year, but that history came out in the next wash and it remains an unassuming argyle sweater.

				"Greg was channel-surfing one day in the fall of 2010 and happened upon a show called 'Rough Cut Woodworking with Tommy Mac' and decided that woodworking was his passion. He went out to the neighborhood hardware depot and got himself all the tools of the trade. At one point, he asked me what I thought of a particular lathe and I told him that until today I had never heard of a lathe, and that he should just go with his gut. Long story same length, he scowled at me and purchased a different lathe. Greg spent the rest of the weekend building what can only be described as the world's biggest birdhouse for the world's smallest bird. If I'm being honest, it was a very good first attempt. I've never seen him so proud of any singular achievement. After that, I think he's only really ever made like 3 more things--an oversized wooden spoon, a featureless, human-shaped doll, and a single bedpost.",

		Review hobby2 = new Review("Upholstery",
				"I hesitate to review this here because 1. I don't know if Greg would consider it a hobby so much as a chore and 2. It sort of grew out of his foray into woodworking. Let me explain. Greg found this chair at a garage sale. It was a beautiful, old chair that had clearly seen better days. He wasn't going to buy it, but, despite my MULTIPLE warnings, he sat in it and all of a sudden everyone within a 3 mile radius heard a crack and Greg was on the ground checking himself for a concussion. He graciously handed the previous owners a generous wad of cash and strapped the chair to the roof of his midsized sedan with some twine. The chair lived in his basement until one day Greg decided to \"just fix the damn thing\". He reattached the leg, sanded down some rough spots, patched up some nicks, and got the thing looking pretty good. The only thing left to do was to replace the god-awful upholstery.  Greg checked out a book from a library and spent an afternoon in a Jo-Ann Fabrics before locking himself in his basement. when he emerged he had a fully-functional, absolutely gorgeous, and shockingly comfy chair. Even Carol was impressed. Now, whenever something happens to their furniture (or Carol decides she wants to shake up the feng shui again), Greg takes care of it. And we are all better for it, no matter how much he grumbles about it.",

		Review hobby3 = new Review("Collecting Shot Glasses",
				"Greg has a simply massive shot glass collection. Yes, I know Mr. \"Oh no a second beer will put me right to sleep\" Greg has somewhere in the area of 1000 shot glasses from all over the world. Yes, I know! Mr. \"Do you think this bar has iced tea\" Greg has more shot glasses than your average bar supplies depot. The whole thing started as a bit of a joke. Most people know that Greg doesn't drink a whole lot, but not a lot of people know why. On Greg's 21st birthday, we threw him a huge party. He was absolutely stoked to finally \"go into the future\" as he called it. Unfortunately, it was not to be. Some of Greg's friends (I'm looking at you Bill (and also you, me)) got a little too enthusiastic, so sweet little Greg had to play babysitter. And janitor. And law enforcement liason. Ever since then, Greg has been less than enthusiastic about alcohol consumption, so much so that a lot of people we know are SHOCKED when Greg does order alcohol. As a result (Greg's general obliviousness are also a very large player in this), there was a period of time where Greg thought that the shot glasses he would find in gift-shops were just tiny commemorative glasses. Greg had done some travelling for work and always came back with one from wherever he went. Then I was getting ready to go on a vacation and I asked Greg if he wanted me to bring him a souvenir. He asked me to bring back \"one of those little baby beer glasses\". I laughed and laughed and laughed and finally clued him in to what he's been buying this whole time. He was a little embarassed, but, in typical Greg fashion dealt with embarassment by leaning into it hard. He will buy any shot glass he finds. I'm pretty sure he's even padded his collection with some just plain shot glasses he got at the liquor store. And now here we are. About 7000 off of the world record, but still nothing to shake a stick at.",

But he was already a my lame friend- I guess there wasn't any further down to go, so I can't hold this life decision against him. On the whole, I think he's learned a bit about responsibility, but forgotten lots more about music not sung by a choir of six year olds, which I would consider a loss. But Greg has never had cool points to loose, so perhaps it's been a net gain. If it weren't for Lizzy I think this would have been an alright descision.",

He had to resort to his terrible Halloween sweater, and after the thanksgiving feast at his parents' house, is was fairly snug. As he was shimmying it over his belly he asked me what I would call an overweight pumpkin. \"What?\", I asked. \"A plumpkin!\", he said, delighted.",
